/*
almost everything is an object

2 types:

    primitives:         objects:

    -numbers            -arrays
    -strings            -functions
    -booleans           -objects
    -undefined          -dates
    -null               -wrappers for numbers, strings, booleans

objects interact with eachother though methods and properties
used to store data, structure applications into modules and keeping code clean

inheritance is when one object gets access to anthers properties/methods
