manicpulate content. JavaScript is the client-side scripting language that connects 
to the DOM in an internet browser-->

<!-- play around in the console. add javascript to the html post it being rendered. 
    this does not change the source code but what is being displayed to the console -->

<!--we are going to manipulate the DOM with console input JavaScript:
      let navLink = document.getElementById('nav');  
        navLink.href = 'https://wikipedia.org';
-->

<!-- all items in the Dom can be defined as nodes. there are 3 types of nodes:

element nodes
text nodes
comment nodes

when an HTML element is an item in the DOM it is reffered to as a element node. any 
content outside of and element is a text node and an HTML comment is a comment node-->
